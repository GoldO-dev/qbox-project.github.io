# Converting to Qbox from Qb

1. Check your job grades in `qbx-core/shared/jobs.lua`. In Qbox, job grades are numbers without quotations, whereas in Qb they are strings.
2. Convert your database to switch from qb-inventory to ox_inventory. Type `convertinventory qb` into the server console. Backup your database first.
