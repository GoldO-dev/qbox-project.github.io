# Hooks

Credit to overextended for the hook system.

Event hooks allow 3rd party resources to define new behaviour without modifying the inventory code directly.

## registerHook

```lua
exports.qbx_medical:registerHook(eventName, function(payload) end)
```

- eventName: `string`
- payload: `table`

Return:

- hookId: `number`

### respawn

Triggered when moving any item from one slot to another, or when "giving" an item.  
By returning `false`, you can cancel the action and revert the inventory state.

```lua
---@param payload {source: number}
```

## removeHooks

Removes a hook created by the invoking resource with the the specified id.  
If no id is specified then all hooks registered by the resource are removed.

```lua
exports.qbx_medical:removeHooks(id)
```

- id?: `number`
