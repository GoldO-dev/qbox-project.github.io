# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the differences between Qb and Qbox?

While originally forked from Qb, many Qbox resources have been refactored to improve code quality, enhance security, lower performance overhead, and integrate with [overextended](https://overextended.dev) resources.
Where appropriate Qbox also integrates directly with other open source projects, rather than maintain subpar resources in-house.
Qbox maintains high quality standards, with a strong community of regular contributors. As time goes on, expect greater differences in player facing features.

## Will Qb compatible scripts work with Qbox?

Yes. We've created a bridge layer for backwards compatibility with Qb scripts. You can continue to use Qb scripts without any modifications.

## When will Qbox get a stable release?

Expect individual resources to get versioned releases over the coming months as they get stabilized and tested.

## Who should use Qbox?

Servers currently using QB and servers interested in running QB resources in the future

# Common Problems

## No Such export GetCoreObject in resource qbx_core
Qbox does not have the core object. However, you can continue to use exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject() to get a core object from Qbox's QB bridge layer.
